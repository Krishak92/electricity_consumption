# electricity_consumption

## Brief Description ##

This project is designed to forecast a plant's electricity consumption.
To do this, we have access to a training dataset containing the evolution
of electricity consumption over one and a half years, as well as the evolution
of 6 factors whose identity is not revealed.

We also have access to a test dataset containing the evolution of the 6 factors
over the test period, and we need to predict electricity consumption over this
period using the model trained on the training dataset.

## Project Description ##

We began this project by carrying out an EDA in order to correctly characterize
the time series under study. We then trained and tested various models,
including SARIMA and LSTM.
